FlindersTimetable
=================

## Project Brief

This project helps Flinders students find their ideal timetable for a semester.

To build the project, you'll need a modern version of Node.js and NPM

Run

    npm install
    bower install
    grunt
    
in the root directory of the project and it'll compile the LESS/JS into the project's /bin directory
