FlindersTimetable
=================

## Project Brief

This project helps Flinders students find their ideal timetable for a semester.



Uses [TobiasWooldridge/FlindersAPI2](https://github.com/TobiasWooldridge/FlindersAPI2) as its data source



## Development instructions

The project makes use of [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), a CSS-like language which compiles to CSS.

To compile the .less files in the project, particularly /less/*, you'll need to use a LESS compiler.

While developing, I'm using the Node.js LESS module.

To install the Node.js LESS module, [install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and run

    npm install less
    
Use the 'lessc' file located somewhere under your node_modules directory to compile /less/styles.less to /css/styles.css
